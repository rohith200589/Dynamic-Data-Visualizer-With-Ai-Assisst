# AI-Driven Dynamic Data Visualizer ðŸ“Š

This project is a **web-based dynamic data visualization tool** powered by **Dash** and **Hugging Face API**.
It enables users to upload datasets (CSV or Excel), analyze them, and generate interactive visualizations with intelligent insights using AI.

---

## Features

- **File Upload**: Supports CSV and Excel file uploads.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Automatically analyzes datasets and suggests axes for graphs.
- **Natural Language Query**: Processes user queries to generate AI-driven insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides options for line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
- **Built-in Dataset**: Includes a default dataset for demonstration purposes.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+
2. Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Add API Key
The source code includes a placeholder for the Hugging Face API key. Update it in the relevant file (app.py or configuration file):

python
Copy code
API_KEY = "your_hugging_face_api_key"
Replace "your_hugging_face_api_key" with your actual Hugging Face API key.

Step 5: Run the Application
Run the Dash app on a local server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050.

Usage
Upload a Dataset: Drag and drop a CSV or Excel file.
Enter a Query: Use natural language to ask questions about the dataset.
Select Graph Type: Choose a graph type from the dropdown.
Generate Visualization: Click the button to generate interactive visualizations.
