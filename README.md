# AI-Driven Dynamic Data Visualizer ðŸ“Š

This project is a **web-based dynamic data visualization tool** powered by **Dash** and **Hugging Face API**. It enables users to upload datasets (CSV or Excel), analyze them, and generate interactive visualizations with intelligent insights using AI.

---

## Features

- **File Upload**: Supports CSV and Excel file uploads.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Automatically analyzes datasets and suggests axes for graphs.
- **Natural Language Query**: Processes user queries to generate AI-driven insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides options for line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
- **Built-in Dataset**: Includes a default dataset for demonstration purposes.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+
2. Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Hugging Face API key:
```env
API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
```

### Step 5: Run the Application
Run the Dash app on a local server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The app will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8050](http://127.0.0.1:8050).
